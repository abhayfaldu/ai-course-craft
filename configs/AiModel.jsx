It prepares your body for physical activity by increasing blood flow to muscles, raising your body temperature, and improving flexibility and range of motion.

Aim for 5-10 minutes.\\n* **Dynamic stretching:** This involves moving your joints through their full range of motion. Examples include arm circles, leg swings, torso twists, and high knees.  Avoid static stretching (holding a stretch) during the warm-up phase.  Focus on controlled movements, repeating each stretch several times.\\n* **Specific warm-up for your workout:**  If you\'re focusing on upper body strength, incorporate light movements like arm rotations and shoulder shrugs.
